This information is what you are currently thinking about, processing, or using to perform a task. Think of it like a mental \"holding area\" where you can temporarily store a few pieces of information, such as phone numbers, instructions, or a to-do list.\n\nSTM has a limited capacity, which means it can only hold a small amount of information at a time. This is often referred to as \"chunking,\" where you group related information together to fit it into your STM. For example, you might be able to remember a phone number by breaking it down into smaller groups of numbers (e.g., 555-1234).\n\nOnce the information in your STM is no longer needed, it's either forgotten or transferred to Long-Term Memory for permanent storage."}, {"role": "user", "content": "explain again"}, {"role": "ai", "content": "Here's another attempt at explaining Short-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory:\n\nShort-Term Memory (STM) is a type of memory that temporarily holds a limited amount of information in your mind.
